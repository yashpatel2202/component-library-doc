## Key Responsibilities of Layout

1. **Shape & Size** – Defines dimensions of the component.
2. **Placement of Data \+ Elements** – Determines where child widgets and data-driven UI pieces appear.
3. **State to UI Mapping** – Decides how internal state and data are reflected in the UI.

---

## Baseline Principles

- Layouts should be **loosely coupled** with internal **Business Logic (BL)**.
- Layout must be **customizable up to a certain level**, without rewriting internal logic.
- Components should be **composable**, able to merge with other standalone widgets.
- This flexibility is achieved via **multiple modes of customization**.

---

## Customization Levels

### **1. Default Layout**

If no customization is provided, the component renders its **default UI**.

- Quick to use (zero-config).
- Useful for most common cases.

**Example:**

```dart
MyCard(
  title: "Hello",
  subtitle: "This is default layout",
);
```

<Note>
  Renders with **default card layout** as provided by the component library.
</Note>

### **2. Semi-Customization**

The component provides **pre-built UI parts** (like puzzle pieces).

- Developer receives **ready-made widgets** and arranges them as desired.
- Component still decides _how the pieces look_, developer decides _where they go_.

**Example (using builder for semi-customization):**

```dart
MyCard.semiCustom(
  title: "Semi Custom",
  subtitle: "Arranged differently",
  layoutBuilder: (context, parts) {
    // parts contains: header, body, footer widgets
    return Column(
      children: [
        parts.header,       // Provided by component
        Row(
          children: [
            Expanded(child: parts.body),
            parts.footer,
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
);
```

<Note>
  Here, `header`, `body`, and `footer` are **pre-rendered widgets** created by the component. Developer only decides the placement.
</Note>

---

### **3. Full Customization**

The component provides **raw data**, not widgets.

- Developer decides how to build UI from data.
- Component still manages **state \+ business logic**, but UI is 100% developer-driven.

**Example (using full customization builder):**

```dart
MyCard.fullCustom(
  dataBuilder: (context, data) {
    // 'data' contains processed BL state, e.g. title, subtitle, actions
    return Container(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
          Text(data.title, style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline6),
          Text(data.subtitle, style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyText2),
          Row(
            children: data.actions.map((action) {
              return ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: action.onTap,
                child: Text(action.label),
              );
            }).toList(),
          )
        ],
      ),
    );
  },
);
```

<Note>
  Here, `data` could be a `CardDataModel` prepared internally by the component’s BL. The developer controls **how it’s rendered**.
</Note>

---

## State Management in Customization (part of BL)

- **State is always managed by the component itself**, even when layout is fully customized.
- Component decides **when to rebuild the builder functions**, ensuring consistency.

### **Semi-Custom Layout**

- State is managed internally (via `Bloc` / `Cubit` ).
- Builder is invoked whenever relevant UI “puzzle pieces” need re-rendering.
- Example: Refresh header when title changes, but not the body.

### **Full-Custom Layout**

- State still comes from internal BL (e.g., data from API, form values).
- Builder is called with **processed state/data** so developer can fully decide how to display it.
- Example: Entire card UI is rebuilt when data model changes.

<Tip>
  Customization in layout also opens the door for [Interdependent Components](/advanced/interdepend).
